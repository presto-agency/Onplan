                How to choose the best
            </h2>
            <p>
                Time Anomalies, otherwise known as temporal distortions or time slips, have long been an interest of
                mine.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first time I remember taking a definite interest was when I was writing a book called The Ghostly
                Guide to the Lake District. As well as collecting local folklore and well-known legends, I wanted to
                bring the material up to date and demonstrate that people continued to have paranormal experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
                I wrote the book in 1998, and I put a notice in the local newspaper asking people to get in touch. A
                woman called Angela Charlton got in touch. At the time, I was living in a town called Penrith, Cumbria,
                England, and this story happened to Angela in Penrith. Stranger still, at the time she had the time slip
                experience she lived in the same house I was living in when I wrote the book.
            </p>
            <h2>

            <p>
                Angela reported a strange experience as she walked on a steep path between pine trees up to the top of
                Beacon Hill that overlooks Penrith. At the time, she was a teenager. Angela would often climb the Beacon
                when she wasn’t at school, and it’s still a popular local walk.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>
                    One hot day in August in the mid-1970s, Angela and a friend set out onto the footpath from Beacon
                    Edge. The walk takes about fifteen minutes, and the path has many abrupt angles as it zig-zags
                    through the trees. The trees crowd thickly round the track as it climbs over craggy sandstone
                    outcrops. Soon you feel quite apart from the everyday world. It’s an odd feeling, and you can have
                    the impression that someone is watching you from the woods on either side. You go up and up,
                    changing direction and losing sight of the path below and behind you.
                </em>
            </p>
            <p>
                As Angela and her friend climbed that day they chatted away, but Angela reports how the atmosphere grew
                increasingly heavy — as if there was thunder in the air. They’d walked up many times and weren’t taking
                much notice of their surroundings until they turned a corner and stopped. They both saw it: an old
                fashioned cottage, roughly made of stone.
            </p>
            <p>
                When she worked up the courage to climb the hill some months later, the cottage wasn’t there. Her friend
                would never talk about the experience.

                Roger said that he and his family had visited Pembroke Castle in Wales. They were climbing the tower,
                and he was a flight or two above his family. When he reached the top of the castle tower, he glanced out
                over the river and saw it was full of medieval boats. He thought there must be some kind of festival on,
                but when he remarked on it, not only had his family not noticed it, but when they went out to look at
                the river, there were no boats.

                    ... As you would imagine, in the years since, I’ve taken one or two walks up that path, in the snow
                    and the sun.
