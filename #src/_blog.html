                Time Anomalies, otherwise known as temporal distortions or time slips, have long been an interest of
                mine.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first time I remember taking a definite interest was when I was writing a book called The Ghostly
                Guide
                to the Lake District. As well as collecting local folklore and well-known legends, I wanted to bring the
                material up to date and demonstrate that people continued to have paranormal experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
                I wrote the book in 1998, and I put a notice in the local newspaper asking people to get in touch. A
                woman
                called Angela Charlton got in touch. At the time, I was living in a town called Penrith, Cumbria,
                England,
                and this story happened to Angela in Penrith. Stranger still, at the time she had the time slip
                experience
                she lived in the same house I was living in when I wrote the book.
            </p>
            <h2 id="2">
                Penrith, Cumbria
            </h2>
            <p>
                Angela reported a strange experience as she walked on a steep path between pine trees up to the top of
                Beacon Hill that overlooks Penrith. At the time, she was a teenager. Angela would often climb the Beacon
                when she wasn’t at school, and it’s still a popular local walk.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>
                    One hot day in August in the mid-1970s, Angela and a friend set out onto the footpath from Beacon
                    Edge.
                    The walk takes about fifteen minutes, and the path has many abrupt angles as it zig-zags through the
                    trees. The trees crowd thickly round the track as it climbs over craggy sandstone outcrops. Soon you
                    feel quite apart from the everyday world. It’s an odd feeling, and you can have the impression that
                    someone is watching you from the woods on either side. You go up and up, changing direction and
                    losing
                    sight of the path below and behind you.
                </em>
            </p>
            <p>
                As Angela and her friend climbed that day they chatted away, but Angela reports how the atmosphere grew
                increasingly heavy — as if there was thunder in the air. They’d walked up many times and weren’t taking
                much
                notice of their surroundings until they turned a corner and stopped. They both saw it: an old fashioned
                cottage, roughly made of stone.
            </p>

                Angela reported a strange experience as she walked on a steep path between pine trees up to the top of
                Beacon Hill that overlooks Penrith. At the time, she was a teenager. Angela would often climb the Beacon
                when she wasn’t at school, and it’s still a popular local walk.

            <p>
                Over the next few years, I taught an evening class on ghosts and legends for adults. I told the story of
                Angela Charlton and one man, Roger, who I happened to know from outside the class, told me his tale.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Title H3
            </h3>
            <p>
                Roger said that he and his family had visited Pembroke Castle in Wales. They were climbing the tower,
                and he
                was a flight or two above his family. When he reached the top of the castle tower, he glanced out over
                the
                river and saw it was full of medieval boats. He thought there must be some kind of festival on, but when
                he
                remarked on it, not only had his family not noticed it, but when they went out to look at the river,
                there
                were no boats.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Title H4
            </h4>
            <p>
                Also in a castle, though they don’t all happen in castles (far from it) there is a story of Alice
                Pollock
                (1868–1971) who visited Leeds Castle in Kent.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Title H4
            </h4>
            <p>
                Pollock was born into the minor aristocracy, and this may have allowed her entry to Leeds Castle in a
                time
                when it was not generally open to the public. Leeds Castle is a famous and picturesque castle not far
                from
                London.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Title H3
            </h3>
            <p>
                Roger had no explanation for this and didn’t make a big deal of it. He probably wouldn’t have mentioned
                it at all if I hadn’t told him the story about the girls climbing the hill in Penrith.

                Title H2
            </h2>
            <p>
                One of the most famous accounts of a timeslip is reported in a book called An Adventure. An Adventure
                was
                initially published in 1910 and gives the accounts of two English women who experienced a timeslip in
                the
                gardens of the Palace of Versailles on August 10th 1901.
            </p>
            <p>
                They wrote the book under pseudonyms — Elizabeth Morison and Frances Lamont — though their actual names
                were
                Charlotte Moberly (1846–1937) and Eleanor Jourdain (1863–1924). Moberly’s father was headmaster at the
                prestigious Winchester School and later Bishop of Salisbury. In her account, she distances herself from
                a
                belief in ghosts and the occult (an epidemic of Spiritualism was sweeping Britain and America at that
                time).
                Jourdain’s father was a vicar of the Church of England.
            </p>
            <p>
                They felt they had walked through the gardens as they were on August 10th 1792, the day the French
                monarchy
                fell during the French Revolution.
            </p>
            <p>
                This account is remarkable for the detail of the statements of the two women and the efforts they went
                to
                establish the historical evidence for their belief that they had strayed into the past.
            </p>
            <p>
                When she worked up the courage to climb the hill some months later, the cottage wasn’t there. Her friend
                would never talk about the experience.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Our template is limited to 100 current staff and 50 new hires.</li>
                <li>A spreadsheet is an inelegant way to manage scenarios. In our case, we created three: a base model,
                    an alternative, and a third to calculate the difference between them. If we wanted to change some of
                    the assumptions, like hiring growth or benefits structure, or adding more than 100 current employees
                    and 50 new hires, we’d need to make those changes exactly the same way to both scenarios to avoid
                    miscalculation.</li>
                <li>Looking at different time horizons is hard. If we wanted to look closer at the cash flow impact in
                    year 1, or change from a quarterly view to a monthly or yearly one, we’d be reworking formulas and
                    recreating charts. That’s a major hassle.</li>
                <li>Keeping a model like this up to date with the latest staff list and comparing the forecast with
                    actuals as time progresses is a pain. You have to import staff data manually each time, copy/pasting
                    it into the right tabs in each scenario.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    ... As you would imagine, in the years since, I’ve taken one or two walks up that path, in the snow
                    and
                    the sun.
                </strong>
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>If you’re working with department heads to consider the strategy, you can’t share the spreadsheet in
                    whole—it contains salaries for every employee in the company. Instead you have to create and keep
                    track of redacted copies.</li>
                <li>We’ve relied on just a few charts in our analysis above. What if we want to see the impact by
                    department, or adjust benefits by job level and see that? Such ad hoc analysis can take many
                    different directions, so being able to really quickly build new views into the data and feed the
                    insights back into the assumptions is critical to figuring out the best approach for your company.

            </h3>
            <p>
                Casual observers would consider Florida, Arkansas, and Utah low-tax states, but as the table below
                shows, it’s not so simple. Arkansas’ SUTA tax rate is almost double New York’s and almost triple
                Florida’s! And in Utah, though the rate is similar to several other states, the tax is applied up to a
                much higher wage level.

                        As Angela and her friend climbed that day they chatted away, but Angela reports how the
                        atmosphere grew increasingly heavy — as if there was thunder in the air. They’d walked up many
                        times and weren’t taking much notice of their surroundings until they turned a corner and
                        stopped. They both saw it: an old fashioned cottage, roughly made of stone.
