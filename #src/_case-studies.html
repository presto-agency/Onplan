                            Redbubble is a marketplace for independent artists to sell their work, headquartered in
                            Australia and with offices in San Francisco and Berlin. It offers a print-on-demand service
                            for
                            independent artists to design and sell products. Artists can include their designs on a wide
                            range of products, including t-shirts, mugs, and coasters. The Australian stock exchange
                            listed
                            organization generates over A$400m in annual revenue.

                        <p>
                            Before implementing OnPlan, Redbubble used a series of google sheets for planning and
                            analysis.
                            Historical financial information for its five legal entities would be copied and pasted
                            manually
                            out of NetSuite and into various google sheets, which would then update a master google
                            sheet
                            used for forecasting and reporting. Key HR information from various payroll software
                            packages
                            would also be updated manually.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The FP&A team wanted to improve its processes by removing the manual elements of the
                            processes
                            to free up more time for analysis. It also wanted to increase the engagement of non finance
                            staff by involving them more directly in the budgeting process and by giving them live
                            access to
                            relevant financial information.

                                    ‘What-if’ scenarios were time consuming to set up and update. Structural changes to
